Select **k** initial cluster centroids.\n  2. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.\n  3. Recalculate centroids based on assigned points.\n  4. Repeat until centroids converge.\n\n## Q3: Advantages and Limitations of K-Means Clustering\n- **Advantages**:\n  - Simple and efficient for large datasets.\n  - Works well with spherical clusters.\n  - Scalable with large data.\n- **Limitations**:\n  - Requires predefined **k**.\n  - Sensitive to outliers and initial centroid placement.\n  - Struggles with non-spherical clusters and varying densities.\n\n## Q4: Determining the Optimal Number of Clusters in K-Means\n- **Common methods**:\n  - **Elbow Method**: Plot inertia vs. k and look for an “elbow.”\n  - **Silhouette Score**: Measures how well points fit within clusters.\n  - **Gap Statistic**: Compares clustering performance against a random dataset.\n\n## Q5: Applications of K-Means Clustering in Real-World Scenarios\n- **Customer segmentation**: Grouping users based on behavior.\n- **Image compression**: Reducing colors in images.\n- **Anomaly detection**: Identifying fraud in transactions.\n- **Market research**: Identifying trends in product preferences.\n- **Biological data analysis**: Grouping similar genes or cells.\n\n## Q6: Interpreting the Output of K-Means Clustering\n- **Cluster centroids**: Represent the average position of points in a cluster.\n- **Cluster assignments**: Show how data points are grouped.\n- **Within-cluster variance**: Indicates cluster compactness.\n- **Insights**:\n  - Understanding similarities between data points.\n  - Detecting hidden patterns in data.\n  - Identifying outliers or misclassified points.\n\n## Q7: Common Challenges in Implementing K-Means Clustering and Solutions\n- **Choosing the right k** → Use elbow method or silhouette score.\n- **Handling outliers** → Preprocess data and use robust clustering techniques.\n- **Scalability** → Use mini-batch K-Means for large datasets.\n- **Dealing with non-spherical clusters** → Consider DBSCAN or hierarchical clustering.\n- **Avoiding poor initial centroids** → Use K-Means++ for better initialization.\n\"\"\"",
