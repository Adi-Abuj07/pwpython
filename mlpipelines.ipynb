What is a Random Forest Regressor?\nA Random Forest Regressor is a machine learning model that uses multiple decision trees to predict numerical values. It improves accuracy and reduces overfitting by combining the results of multiple trees.\n\n### Q2. How does it prevent overfitting?\nInstead of relying on a single decision tree (which may memorize the data), Random Forest trains multiple trees on random subsets of data and features. Then, it averages their predictions, making the model more generalizable.\n\n### Q3. How does it combine multiple trees for predictions?\nEach decision tree makes its own prediction, and the final result is the average of all tree predictions. This averaging helps smooth out errors and improves accuracy.\n\n### Q4. What are the key settings (hyperparameters) for a Random Forest Regressor?\nHere are some important ones:\n- `n_estimators`: Number of trees in the forest.\n- `max_depth`: How deep each tree can grow.\n- `min_samples_split`: Minimum samples needed to split a node.\n- `min_samples_leaf`: Minimum samples needed in a leaf node.\n- `max_features`: Number of features considered at each split.\n- `bootstrap`: Whether to randomly sample data with replacement.\n\n### Q5. How is it different from a Decision Tree Regressor?\n- **Decision Tree**: Uses one tree, which can overfit the data.\n- **Random Forest**: Uses multiple trees and averages their results, reducing overfitting and improving accuracy.\n\n### Q6. What are its strengths and weaknesses?\n**Pros:**\n- More accurate and stable than a single decision tree.\n- Works well on large datasets.\n- Handles missing data and noisy data effectively.\n\n**Cons:**\n- Slower to train and predict compared to a single tree.\n- Harder to interpret compared to a single decision tree.\n\n### Q7. What does a Random Forest Regressor predict?\nIt predicts a **continuous numerical value**, which is the average output of multiple decision trees.\n\n### Q8. Can it be used for classification?\nYes! The same Random Forest concept works for classification by selecting the **most common** class label among all decision trees instead of averaging numerical values.\n",
